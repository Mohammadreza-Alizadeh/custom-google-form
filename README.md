# custom-google-form
Reverse engineering of Google Forms

### What is it exactly ?
Well, I was planning to create a registration form for new members of the Computer Science Association, but I didn't want to waste time on backend and Database, so I decided to use Google Forms, but Google didn't provide me with a nice looking form, so I created a form with Bootstrap and CSS and sent the user's inputs to Google Form with `<form action="my-google-form-url" >` for processing and storage, so I was able to design a form with the desired appearance and Google's backend process.

you can use this form as an example, pay attention to input's names, you have to name them exactly as google-form provide you
